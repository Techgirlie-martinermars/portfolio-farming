            <h2 class="mb-3">Welcome to Divine Farm</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Meet Martiner Winceit, a young and dynamic individual hailing from
              the vibrant landscapes of Kenya who was once a dreamer of Divine
              Farm. While she's currently immersed in the world of coding and
              technology as an aspiring front-end developer, pursuing a rigorous
              program at Shecodes, her heart also beats passionately for
              agriculture. This unique blend of interests sets her apart as a
              modern Renaissance soul, poised to bridge the gap between tech and
              agriculture. With her newfound skills in front-end development,
              Martiner can revolutionize the agricultural landscape in Kenya and
              beyond. She can create user-friendly websites and mobile apps to
              connect farmers with valuable resources, such as weather
              forecasts, market prices, and crop management tools, making it
              easier for them to navigate the challenges of farming.
              Additionally, she can use her coding prowess to develop e-commerce
              platforms for local farmers, enabling them to sell their produce
              online and reach a broader market. Martiner's journey is a
              testament to the power of combining passions and knowledge to
              drive innovation and transformation in the fields she cares about
              most.
